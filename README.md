Sign Talk Application

SignTalk is a mobile-based application designed to assist individuals in communicating with the speech and hearing impaired. Developed by a team of students from the Faculty of Informatics at Telkom University—Alfara Nafi Dinara, Mustaghfir Naufal Zaidan, Bagus Adi Saputra, and A. Ahyaul Wajdi—as a major project for the Software Engineering course, this application offers solutions for translating sign language into text and provides resources for learning sign language.

Key Features:

Detection Camera: This feature allows users to translate sign language in real-time using their device's camera. The camera records the sign movements, and the application translates them into text.

Learn Sign Language: Users can access and create articles about sign language. These articles can be read and shared with others to facilitate learning.

User Profile: Users can create and edit their profiles, as well as view their translation history.

Translation History: This feature allows users to review previous sign translations.

Benefits:

Improved Communication: Facilitates interaction between speech-impaired individuals and others by translating sign language into readable text.
Learning Resource: Helps users learn sign language through articles and translation history.
Accessibility: Allows users to access the application and its functions anywhere with a mobile device and internet connection.
User Characteristics:

General Users: Individuals who want to translate signs or learn sign language without requiring special technical skills.
Admin: Users with higher technical skills responsible for managing and ensuring the SignTalk system functions properly.
Limitations:

Requires a camera with good resolution and lighting for accurate sign detection.
Accessible only through mobile devices with Android operating systems and an internet connection.
